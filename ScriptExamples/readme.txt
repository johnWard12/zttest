You can use scripts to automate the execution of load test jobs.

Scripting load test jobs is an advanced option and ** NOT NEEDED ** to execute single
load test programs from a local or from a remote Exec Agent, or from an Exec Agent cluster. 

** Usually you should use the Web GUI (Project Navigator) to execute load test jobs **

The Web GUI as well as load test scripts allow to execute several load test jobs at the
same time.

Please read chapter 4 of the "Application Reference Manual" to learn more about scripting
load test jobs.
